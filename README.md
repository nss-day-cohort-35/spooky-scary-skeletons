Upon opening the webpage, new users are greeted to a sign in page. Those that are not registered can do so quickly and easily. Once logged in, the user will be directed to a homepage to view their new material at a glance. Clicking on the tabs in the nav bar will lead to the chat room, daily tasks, events, and news, depending on the tabs clicked

### Chat Room

The chat room is where the user can make friends and chat with everyone registered online. The user can add and edit their messages, as well as click on the names of the other people to follow them. One can also add friends by searching for them and adding them to the list.

### Task List

The task list is straightforward, allowing to create and edit new tasks to be done on a deadline. When the user clicks the check box, the completed task will move to the "finished" list. There, the task can be safely deleted.
